First category is simple and easy to solve
- 3 ways to be solved
    1. brute force by nested loop
     Time complexity:
     O(n2)
     Space complexity:
     O(1)
     2. sorting first
     Time complexity:
     O(nlog n)
     Space complexity:
     O(1)
     3. using hash
     Time complexity:
     O(n)
     Space complexity:
     O(n)
